Message:

This problem is based on Null Cipher problem.  Now we want your program
to work with vowels that are either upper case or lower case.  And since we
are not savages, we should be able to encode any type of printable ASCII
characters, from spaces till the tilde.

Btw, if you want to see an ascii table real quick on Linux, try the following:
man ascii

The sample input generates the same sample output (mostly...) as the last
problem did. You might need some other skills to finish this challenge, but I'm
sure you can figure it out.
