This problem is in the PDF, and is from the 2022 Code Quest programming
competition. It's an example of stegenography.  We will see many more steg
techniques as we play CTFs.

Most coding challenges will give you a bunch of text input for your program,
and expect your program to output an answer. This is going to be easiest to
do from the command line.  You can put the sample input and / or real input
in text files and use the shell command piping features to run the program.
Have a general pattern for reading input, be able to code it fast during the
competition.

Learn about Linux shell piping:

After you test your program and get it working with the sample input, decode
the ciphertext to get your flag.
